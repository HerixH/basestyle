# üöÄ Deploy Your NFT Smart Contract

## Quick Deployment Guide

Follow these steps to deploy your AppreciationNFT contract to Base.

---

## Step 1: Install Contract Dependencies

```bash
cd contracts
npm install
```

This will install:
- Hardhat
- OpenZeppelin contracts
- Deployment tools

---

## Step 2: Set Up Your Private Key

### A. Create `.env` file in `contracts` folder:

```bash
# In contracts directory
touch .env
```

### B. Add your wallet private key:

Open `contracts/.env` and add:

```env
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
BASESCAN_API_KEY=your_basescan_api_key
```

### C. How to get your private key:

**From MetaMask:**
1. Open MetaMask
2. Click the 3 dots menu
3. Account Details ‚Üí Show Private Key
4. Enter password
5. Copy the private key

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: Never share this or commit it to git!

### D. Get Basescan API Key (for verification):

1. Go to https://basescan.org/myapikey
2. Sign up (free)
3. Create new API key
4. Copy and add to `.env`

---

## Step 3: Get ETH for Gas Fees

### For Testnet (Base Sepolia) - FREE:

1. Go to: https://www.coinbase.com/faucets/base-ethereum-goerli-faucet
2. Connect your wallet
3. Request testnet ETH (free!)
4. Wait ~1 minute to receive

### For Mainnet (Base) - REAL ETH NEEDED:

**Option 1: Bridge from Ethereum**
- Go to: https://bridge.base.org
- Bridge ETH from Ethereum to Base
- Cost: ~$5-15 + bridge fees

**Option 2: Buy on Coinbase**
- Buy ETH on Coinbase
- Send to Base network
- Cheaper and easier!

---

## Step 4: Deploy to Testnet (Recommended First)

```bash
# Make sure you're in contracts directory
cd contracts

# Deploy to Base Sepolia testnet
npm run deploy:testnet
```

You should see:
```
Deploying AppreciationNFT contract...
Deploying contracts with account: 0xYourAddress
Account balance: 0.5 ETH
AppreciationNFT deployed to: 0xYourContractAddress
‚úÖ Deployment complete!
```

**Copy the contract address!** You'll need it in Step 6.

---

## Step 5: Verify Contract on Basescan (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
npx hardhat verify --network baseSepolia YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS
```

This makes your contract:
- ‚úÖ Viewable on Basescan
- ‚úÖ Shows source code
- ‚úÖ Proves it's legitimate
- ‚úÖ Builds trust with users

---

## Step 6: Add Contract Address to Your App

### A. Open your main `.env.local` file (in root directory)

### B. Add this line:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_NFT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0xYourContractAddressHere
```

Replace `0xYourContractAddressHere` with the actual contract address from Step 4.

### C. For testnet, also add:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_ID=84532
```

---

## Step 7: Restart Your App

```bash
# In root directory (not contracts)
npm run dev
```

---

## Step 8: Test NFT Minting

1. Open your app in browser
2. Sign in with your wallet
3. Find a post
4. Click "Mint NFT"
5. Confirm transaction in wallet
6. ‚úÖ NFT should be minted!

Check your wallet - the NFT should appear in your collection!

---

## üéØ Deploy to Mainnet (Production)

Once testing works on testnet:

### 1. Get Real ETH on Base

You need ~$10-20 worth of ETH:
- $5-15 for deployment
- $5 for initial test transactions

### 2. Deploy to Base Mainnet

```bash
cd contracts
npm run deploy:mainnet
```

### 3. Verify on Basescan

```bash
npx hardhat verify --network base YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS
```

### 4. Update `.env.local` for Production

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_NFT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0xYourMainnetContractAddress
NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_ID=8453
```

### 5. Deploy Your App

Deploy to Vercel with the new environment variables.

## üí∞ Cost Breakdown

### Testnet (Base Sepolia):
- Deployment: **FREE** ‚ú®
- NFT Minting: **FREE** ‚ú®
- All testing: **FREE** ‚ú®

### Mainnet (Base):
- Deploy Contract: **~$5-15** (one-time)
- Mint NFT: **~$0.10-0.50** (per mint)
- Send USDC: **~$0.05-0.20** (per transaction)

## üîç Verify Deployment Worked

### Check on Basescan:

https://sepolia.basescan.org/address/YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS

**Mainnet:**
https://basescan.org/address/YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS

You should see:
- ‚úÖ Contract created

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### "Insufficient funds for gas"
‚Üí You need ETH on Base network (not Ethereum mainnet!)
‚Üí Use the faucet for testnet or bridge ETH for mainnet

### "Invalid private key"
‚Üí Make sure there's no `0x` prefix in your `.env` file
‚Üí Private key should be 64 characters

### "Network not configured"
‚Üí Check `contracts/hardhat.config.ts` has Base networks
‚Üí Make sure you're using the right network name

### "Contract not found in app"
‚Üí Make sure `NEXT_PUBLIC_NFT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` is set
‚Üí Restart your Next.js dev server after adding env var

### Can't find `npm` command
‚Üí Make sure you have Node.js 18+ installed
‚Üí Download from: https://nodejs.org
