## 🔑 Step 1: Add Your Private Key (Required)

### A. Create `.env` file in `contracts` folder:

Copy `contracts/.env.template` to `contracts/.env`

### B. Get Your Private Key from MetaMask:

1. Open MetaMask browser extension
2. Click the **3 dots** (⋮) menu
3. Click **Account Details**
4. Click **Show Private Key**
5. Enter your MetaMask password
6. **Copy the private key** (64 characters, without 0x)

### C. Add to `contracts/.env`:

```env
PRIVATE_KEY=paste_your_private_key_here
BASESCAN_API_KEY=optional_for_now
```

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: 
- Never share this private key
- Never commit `.env` to git (it's already in .gitignore)
- Use a test wallet if possible

## 💰 Step 2: Get FREE Test ETH on Base Sepolia

### Get Testnet ETH (100% Free):

1. **Visit the Base Sepolia Faucet:**
   👉 https://www.coinbase.com/faucets/base-ethereum-goerli-faucet

2. **Connect your wallet** (the same one you got the private key from)

3. **Request testnet ETH** (it's free!)

4. **Wait 1-2 minutes** for it to arrive

5. **Verify you received it:**
   - Check MetaMask
   - Make sure you're on "Base Sepolia" network
   - You should see ~0.05 ETH (free test ETH)

### Switch to Base Sepolia Network in MetaMask:

If you don't see Base Sepolia network:
1. Click network dropdown in MetaMask
2. Click "Add Network"
3. Search for "Base Sepolia"
4. Add it

## 🚀 Step 3: Deploy Your Contract

Once you have:
- ✅ Private key in `.env`
- ✅ Test ETH in your wallet

Run this command:

```bash
cd C:\Users\User\Desktop\Basesytle\contracts
npm run deploy:testnet
```

You'll see:
```
Deploying AppreciationNFT contract...
Deploying contracts with account: 0x...
Account balance: 0.05 ETH
AppreciationNFT deployed to: 0xYourContractAddress
✅ Deployment complete!
```

**Copy the contract address!**

---

## 📝 Step 4: Add Contract to Your App

1. Open `C:\Users\User\Desktop\Basesytle\.env.local`

2. Add this line:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_NFT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0xYourContractAddress
```

3. For testnet, also add:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_ID=84532
```

---

## 🔄 Step 5: Restart Your App

```bash
cd C:\Users\User\Desktop\Basesytle
npm run dev
```

## ✨ Step 6: Test NFT Minting

1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. Sign in with your wallet
3. Create a post or find an existing one
4. Click **"Mint NFT"**
5. Confirm in MetaMask
6. ✅ NFT minted on Base Sepolia!

Check your NFT:
- View in MetaMask (NFTs tab)
- View on Basescan: https://sepolia.basescan.org

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Network connection failed"
- Check your internet connection
- Try again in a few minutes
- Base Sepolia RPC might be temporarily down
